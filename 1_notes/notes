eating cookies 
inputs = 
	n cookies
outputs = the number of possible ways to eat cookies

relationship between input and output:
	1 cookie
	2 cookies
	3 cookies

walk through problem in a mechanical function:
 our inputs is given as 3
1. |||
2. 2|
3. |2
4. 3

n-1
n-2
n-3

what am i building?
we are building a function

PLAN
def eating_cookies(n)
check negative cookies
check for n = 0
we’re going to make a recursive call
recurse eating cookies
id base case


if n<0  -> venture 0
id base case 
if n=0
return !
else
return eating_cookies(n-1)+ eating_cookies(n-2)+ eating_cookies(n-3)
